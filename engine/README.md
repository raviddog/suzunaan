# Readme

Custom game engine that I'll be using for my game development endeavours. There's kind of no documentation, because I don't have time for that. If you want to attempt to use it, clone the repo into your development directory, add the folder to your CMakeLists.txt, and link the "engine" library. You can check out my other open source games to see how it's used.
